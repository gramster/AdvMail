@entry{START,Getting Started}

AdvanceMail/Remote is a Unix-based full screen mail application that allows
an OpenMail user to manage their mail. It operates in client-server mode, i.e. 
it may run on a different machine to the OpenMail server. In order to use 
AdvanceMail/Remote, you need to be defined as a user on the OpenMail server. 
Please check with your administrator before trying to run AdvanceMail/Remote.

AdvanceMail/Remote allows access to the full range of OpenMail functionality, 
with a hypertext online help system. AdvanceMail/Remote supports reading, 
sending, and filing of mail messages.  
 
@entry{RUNNING,  Running AdvanceMail/Remote}

To run AdvanceMail/Remote, simply type `advremote <Enter>' at the prompt. 
AdvanceMail/Remote will present you with the @ref{LOGINSCREEN,login screen}, where you will be 
required to enter your user details. These details include:


        The OpenMail Server Name
        Your User Name
        Your Password


Make sure that you know these details before you run AdvanceMail/Remote for
the first time.

@entry{NAVIGATING,  Navigating AdvanceMail/Remote}

Navigating AdvanceMail/Remote is done by a combination of the arrow keys,
the enter key, the function keys, and the page-up and page down keys. The
arrow keys move the cursor highlight bar up and down, the Enter key takes
action, usually opening a container item unless entering text at a prompt,
or entering an address line, in which case the Enter key terminates input. 
The function keys all take some type of action, which is clearly indicated
on the function key label at the bottom of the screen. The @ref{LOGINSCREEN,Login Screen}
function key labels show what keystroke corresponds to the function key in
each of the positions 1 - 8.

The pageup key displays the previous page of data, while the pagedown key
displays the next page of data. On some terminals, the pageup and pagedown
keys do not work, so AdvanceMail/Remote provides an alternate keystroke 
sequence for pageup and pagedown that always works, irrespective of the 
terminal type you are using. The keystroke for pageup is <CTRL-U> and for 
pagedown <CTRL-D>.
.np
To move between data entry fields, use the up and down cursor keys and
the tab key. When the cursor is positioned on a data field you can move
within the field with the left and right arrow keys. Use backspace and
delete to delete characters within a data field. Typing a character will
cause the character to be inserted in the field.

Some fields are `toggle' fields; that is, they have a limited set of
values which can be changed by pressing the space bar. The most common
examples are fields which can be set to `YES' or `NO'.

Most data fields perform some form of data validation before you can
leave the field. The type of validation depends on whether the field
holds a date, a time, an address, or a number.

@entry{LOGINSCREEN,  The Login Screen}

The first screen you see when you run AdvanceMail/Remote is the Login Screen.
Here, you will be prompted for

        Server:         The name (or address) of the OpenMail server. 
                        Your administrator will have this information.
                        Enter the OpenMail Server Name and press <Enter>.

        User Name:      Your user name. This is in the form `FirstName 
                        Surname'. Enter your user name and press <Enter>.

        Password:       Your assigned password. The password will not, for 
                        security reasons, be echoed on the screen. If you 
                        forget your password, please contact the OpenMail 
                        Administrator, who will be able to reset it. 
                        Enter your password and press <Enter>.
.np
For your convenience, AdvanceMail/Remote can partially automate the login 
process by saving your user name and the OpenMail server name to its @ref{CONFIGURING,config} 
file. 

@entry{MAINSCREEN,  The Main Screen}

After successfully completing the @ref{LOGINSCREEN,Login Screen}, you will see the Main Screen. 
This screen shows the areas that constitute your mailstore. The areas and 
their functions are:


                                Main OpenMail Areas



                @ref{INTRAY,In Tray}            A holding area for messages sent 
                                        to you.

                @ref{OUTTRAY,Out Tray}           A holding area for outgoing messages.
 
                @ref{FILECABINET,Filing Cabinet}     The area that contains folders where 
                                   you can file your mail messages.
 
                @ref{DISTLISTS,List Area}          Contains your private distribution 
                                   lists.

                @ref{PENDINGTRAY,Pending Tray}       Area where you may view the 
                                   acknowledgement status of messages 
                                   you have sent.

		@ref{BBAREA,Bulletin Boards}	Area for common messages

You  may enter any of these areas by moving the cursor bar to the desired 
entry and pressing <Enter> or <F1>. AdvanceMail/Remote will open this area 
and display its contents.

@entry{GETTINGHELP,  Getting Help}

AdvanceMail/Remote has full context sensitive help. Pressing the help key will 
give help for the area of AdvanceMail/Remote you are in at present. Each help 
screen has hypertext links to other related areas. These links may be accessed
by moving the highlighted cursor bar with the arrow keys to the desired 
reference, and pressing <Enter>. Alternatively, you may select the <Index> key
to see a list of all possible help topics.
  
@entry{OUTTRAY,The Out Tray}

The Out Tray is essentially a holding area for messages that you wish to send.
Conceptually, you @ref{EDITING,compose} a message and put it in your out tray. The system
then picks up the message from the out tray, and mails it to the users
selected in the message's @ref{DISTLISTS,distribution list}.  

You may @ref{READING,read}, @ref{PRINTING,print}, @ref{DELETING,delete}, @ref{CREATING,create} and @ref{MAILING,mail} a message from the out tray
screen. Using the <Other keys> option, you may also @ref{OPENING,open} a multipart message, 
and @ref{FILING,file} a message.

@entry{CREATING,  Creating a Message}

In order to create a message, press the function key <Create>. You will be 
presented with a screen to fill in the subject and @ref{ADDRESSING,addressees} of the message.

@entry{ADDRESSING,  Addressing a Message}

There are three steps to @ref{CREATING,creating} a basic message. The first of these is to
enter a subject for the message. This is done in the `subject' field at
the top of the message. Once you have entered the subject, you need to key in
the addresses of the users. There are two ways of doing this:

 
        You know the address    Key in the address in OpenMail @ref{POSITIONALFORMAT,positional} 
                                format.

        You are unsure of the    
        address and need to 
        query the directory     Search the directory

Let's say that you wish to send a message to Ian Cooper, but are unsure of the
full @ref{OPENMAILADDRESSES,OpenMail address} for Ian Cooper. In the TO field, key in Coo* and press
Enter. All OpenMail address listed in the directory that start with a surname
of `Coo' will be displayed in a popup window at the top left of the screen.
Using the arrow keys, move down the list until you have highlighted the
address that corresponds to the person you wish to mail, and press Enter.
AdvanceMail/Remote will insert the address in the TO field your cursor was in 
prior to invoking the @ref{DIRSEARCH2,search} facility. 

Continue filling in the @ref{ADDRESSING,distribution list} in this fashion until you have
specified all the people to receive your address. If you wish to copy or
blind copy (a blind copied person will not show up in the distribution list  
as a recipient of the message) a person, press the <TO/CC/BCC/FROM> to 
toggle the type of the address. 

If you wish to send to a user who is on an external mail system, such as the
worldwide @ref{X400,X.400} or @ref{FOREIGNADDRESS,Internet} networks, you will need to fill in an extended
address form.
   
@entry{EDITING,  Editing a Message}

AdvanceMail/Remote has a simple inbuilt text editor to allow you to compose 
and edit a message. To enter the text of your message, select the <Compose> 
key. From here, you may enter the text of the message. The editing keys are: 

                        Message Editing Keys

                Function                        Keystroke 
                _______________________________________________

                Start Of Line                   Home or Ctrl-A
                End Of Line                     End or Ctrl-X
                Delete Line                     Ctrl-Y
                Previous Word                   Ctrl-P
                Next Word                       Ctrl-N
                Page Up                         PgUp or Ctrl-U
                Page Down                       PgDn or Ctrl-D
.np
                Left Character                  Left Arrow
                Right Character                 Right Arrow
                Down Line                       Down Arrow
                Up Line                         Up Arrow
                Split Line                      Enter
                Join Line                       Delete (at EOL)

By default, the editor performs automatic word wrapping. You may turn this
option off if you wish. If lines are longer than 80 columns, and you turn on
word wrapping, AdvanceMail/Remote will reformat the input text, wrapping lines
as necessary as soon as you press a key within that line.

The top status line of the display shows your current line and column number,
as well as the current size of your message. Once you have finished entering 
the text of your message, press the <Save Text> key. 

@entry{FILEATTACH,  Attaching a File}

If you wish to attach a file to the message, press the <Include File/Doc>
key. You will be prompted at the top of the screen for:

        The File Type   Use the space bar to toggle the file type until 
                        the desired type appears.

        The File Name   Enter the file name you wish to send.


Please be wary of attaching large files to messages unless absolutely 
necessary, as it can have a noticeable impact on the network throughput.

Once you have entered these two bits of information, press the 
<Perform Include> key, and the file will be attached to your message.
.np
If you wish to see what body parts your message contains, press the 
<Open Message> key. Your message will be @ref{OPENING,opened}, and the various
body parts, along with their type, will be displayed. You may then read, 
print, or delete any of these body parts at your discretion. Be aware that 
you will not be able to delete the primary distribution list, as this is what 
tells OpenMail where to send the message. 

@entry{CHANGESUBJECT,  Changing the Message Subject}

When you are viewing an open message in the Out Tray or in the Folder area,
you can change the message subject by pressing the `Change Subject' key. A
prompt will appear at the top of the screen. Enter the new subject and press
ENTER or the `Perform Change' key.

@entry{MAILING,  Mailing Your Message}

Once you have completed composing and attaching files to your message, you
may mail it by pressing the <Mail Message> key. 

@entry{INTRAY,The In Tray}

The In Tray is the area where you receive messages sent and copied to you.
When entering the in tray area, the messages you have received and kept
in your in tray are listed, with the oldest message at the top of the list,
and the newest at the bottom of the list. 

On the top left, a status line tells you how many messages you have in your in
tray. 

For each message, the subject, sender, date received, and flags are listed. 
The @ref{MESSAGESETTINGS,message flags} tell you several things about a message you have received. 
The flags appear on the right hand side of the in tray screen. An asterisk 
under a flag heading means that the message beside which the asterisk appears 
has this particular flag set for the message. The possible flags are itemized 
below:
.np
        TO      The message was addressed directly to you, rather than being 
                addressed to someone else and copied to you.

        NEW     The message is new (i.e.\ unread).

        ACK     An acknowledgment receipt was requested by the sender.

        PRI     The message is private.

        URG     The message is urgent.

@entry{READING,  Reading a Message}

In order to read a message, move the cursor highlight bar onto the desired
message and press <Enter> or <Read>. AdvanceMail/Remote will open and 
display the message. From here, you may @ref{PRINTING,print}, @ref{DELETING,delete}, @ref{REPLYING,reply} or @ref{FORWARDING,forward}
the message to another user. Selecting <Other Keys> will display
a new set of function key labels that will allow you to @ref{FILING,file} the message
away or @ref{OPENING,open} the message to view what types of body parts are contained
in the message. 

Any binary message parts will not be displayed. For such body parts, you will
see a message indicating that the body part is not of text type and cannot
be displayed on the terminal.
 
@entry{PRINTING,  Printing a Message}

You may print a message either from the main in tray screen, or while @ref{READING,reading}
the message. To print, press the <Print> key. Your message will be printed 
using the Unix lp command. This print command by be @ref{PRINTSETUP,overridden} by adjusting 
the @ref{CONFIGURING,setup} options. 

@entry{DELETING,  Deleting a Message}

You may delete a message either from the main in tray screen, or while
reading the message. To delete, press the <Delete> key. If in the main
@ref{INTRAY,in tray} screen, the message list and count will automatically be updated.
If @ref{READING,reading} the message, you will be returned to the main in tray screen,
and the message list and count will be updated. All deleted messages are
moved to the wastebasket @ref{FILECABINET,folder}, where they remain for a period of time 
before they are discarded. 

@entry{FORWARDING,  Forwarding a Message}

Forwarding a message is much like @ref{CREATING,sending} a message. As with @ref{PRINTING,print} and @ref{DELETING,delete},
you may forward a message both from the main @ref{INTRAY,in tray} screen and while @ref{READING,reading}
the message. To forward a message, press the <Forward> key. From here on,
the procedure is almost identical to sending a message. You fill in the 
distribution list with the @ref{DIRSEARCH2,desired addressees}, and mail the message.

@entry{REPLYING,  Replying to a Message}

As with @ref{FORWARDING,forwarding}, replying to a message is much like sending a message. In
order to reply to a message, you press the <Reply> key. You have an
additional two things that are important here: the `Reply To' field, and 
the text of the reply.

The `Reply To' field at the top of the screen is changed by putting the
cursor in this field and repeatedly pressing <Spacebar> to toggle the 
value. You may reply to the sender of the message, or you may reply to all 
addressees listed on the message. This will include those who were copied 
in the original message.

The second thing you need to do when replying to a message is to @ref{EDITING,compose} the
text of your reply. This is done by pressing the <Compose>  key. Composing
your reply is identical in every respect to the procedure you follow when 
@ref{CREATING,creating} a new message. When you have finished composing your reply, press 
<Save Reply> to save your reply, then <Mail Reply> to @ref{MAILING,mail} the reply
to the selected addressees.

@entry{OPENING,  Opening a Message}

OpenMail messages consist of multiple body parts. You may think of these as 
separate files, if it makes it easier to conceptualize. A mail message 
generally has two body parts:

        A @ref{DISTLIST,Distribution List} that contains the @ref{OPENMAILADDRESSES,addressees}

        A textual body part that contains the message

Often, a message will contain additional bodyparts. If, for example, you
@ref{REPLYING,reply} to a message, an extra body part gets added - the text of your reply.
@ref{OPENING,Opening} a message allows you to view the various body parts that constitute
the message. Once open, you may @ref{EDITING,edit}/@ref{DELETING,delete}/@ref{PRINTING,print} any of the body parts that
comprise the message (with the exception described above).

@entry{SAVINGITEM,  Saving a Message Item}

You may also save a body part to a file. There are two ways you may save a
body part:

        1. As text

        2. In its original format


If you wish to save an item as text, select the <Save Item as Text> key.
AdvanceMail/Remote will prompt you for the name of the file to which you wish 
to write the body part.

If the body part is a textual body part, it will be saved as is. If, however,
the body part is non-text, OpenMail will try to convert it to text before
saving it. OpenMail has several predefined conversions available, and may be
configured to support new file types.

If you request to save an item as text and OpenMail cannot perform the 
conversion, an error will be returned to AdvanceMail/Remote. 

If you wish to save an item in its native format, simply select <Save Item>
and enter the name of the file to save to when prompted.

@entry{FILING,  Filing a Message}

When you wish to keep a message, but don't want it to clutter up your in tray,
you use the <filing mechanism> to save the message away to a folder. 
If you have a message in your in tray that you wish to file, select <File>
and a popup listbox with the available @ref{FILECABINET,folders} will be displayed in the top 
right corner of your screen. Using the arrow keys, select the desired folder
and press <Move to Folder> or <Copy to Folder> depending on whether you wish 
to move  or copy the item to the folder. Since OpenMail permits nested 
folders, you may need to press <Enter> on a folder name in the popup box to 
see the nested folders that it contains.  

You may, if you wish, create a new folder at this point by pressing 
<Create Folder>. You will be prompted for the name of the new folder, upon 
which the folder will be created. Move or copy the message to the new folder.

@entry{FILECABINET,The Filing Cabinet}

The Filing Cabinet is an area, much like your in tray, that contains all the 
defined folders. You may press <Enter> on any of the folders in the file 
cabinet, and it will be opened, displaying its contents in the same fashion 
as the in tray. At this point, you may proceed  to process the items in this 
folder in exactly the same fashion as items in your @ref{INTRAY,in tray}. A point to note 
here is that folders may be nested within folders. Clicking on a nested folder
will open this folder to display the contents.

The Waste Basket folder deserves special mention. All deleted messages are
in fact moved to this folder. After a predefined length of time, the waste
basket is emptied. If you choose to log copies of your outgoing messages,
they are copied to the waste basket when you send them. 
.np
Use the filing cabinet to logically organize your mail you wish to keep. The
hierarchical nature of OpenMail folders allow a strict organization of your
mail into functionally related areas. You may create folders using the 
@ref{CREATEFOLDER,<Create Folder>} key, delete folders using the <Delete Folder> key, reorganize 
the order of the folders using the <Re-order> key, and open folders by 
pressing <Enter> on the desired folder. 

@entry{CREATEFOLDER,  Creating a Folder or Area}

When creating a new folder, you will be prompted to enter a name. Type the
name and press ENTER or the `Perform Create' key.

You can also create a new folder when @ref{FILING,filing} a message.

@entry{RENAMEFOLDER,  Renaming a Folder}

When you open a folder to see the messages it contains, you can rename the
folder by pressing the `Rename Folder' key. A prompt will appear at the top
of the screen. Enter the new folder name and press ENTER or `Perform Rename'.

@entry{PENDINGTRAY,Pending Tray}

When you request an @ref{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,acknowledgement} on a message, you need to be able to view 
the @ref{TRACKING,tracking} status of these messages. The Pending Tray provides this 
functionality. In the pending tray will be a list of all messages (their 
subject and date sent) on which you have requested an acknowledgement. 

To view the message, highlight it with the cursor bar, and press <Enter>.
The message will be displayed in the same manner as messages in your in tray.

@entry{TRACKING,Tracking A Message}

If you wish to view the acknowledgement status for a message, press the
<Track Message> key. You will be presented with a screen that shows
each recipient of the message on the left, and the acknowledgement status
on the right. You will see whether the message has been delivered, read,
replied to, or deleted. Exit this screen by pressing <Done>.

Please remember to delete the item in the Pending Tray when you have finished
tracking the message.

@entry{BBAREA,The Bulletin Board Area}

The Bulletin Board Area is a common posting area for messages. It contains
bulletin boards (created by the mail adminstrator), which in turn may
contain other bulletin boards and messages. You can move through the 
top-level list of boards with the cursor keys, and enter a particular 
board area by pressing ENTER. In fact, using the Bulletin Board Area is
much like using the @ref{FILECABINET,Filing Cabinet}, with a few differences:

  * all users share the bulletin board area
  * messages are grouped within areas or folders, not just folders
  * only the administrator can create and delete top-level boards
  * messages and folders cannot be edited from within the bulletin board area
  * only the administrator or the creator of a message or area can delete
	the message or area
.np
To post a message to a bulletin board, use an address of the form:

    +BB / <mailserver> ( <bulletin board name> )

for example:

    +BB / JHB (Sales Department Notices)

@entry{DIRECTORY,The OpenMail Directory}

The OpenMail directory contains all the @ref{OPENMAILADDRESSES,addresses} for OpenMail users, as well
as @ref{FOREIGNADDRESS,foreign addresses} (i.e., non-OpenMail addresses) which are used often.
The OpenMail Administrator can add non-OpenMail addresses to the directory.

@entry{OPENMAILADDRESSES,  OpenMail Addresses}

OpenMail addresses consist of a User Name, incorporating a Given name, a
Surname, and a mailnode. An OpenMail mailnode provides  unique organizational
information about a user, and allows several users by the same name to be
uniquely identified by their mailnode. Mailnodes are created by the OpenMail
Administrator according to some organizational policy that reflects the 
internal structure of the organization.

OpenMail provides four levels of organizational unit which together comprise 
the mailnode. For example, we could define a mailnode as /HQ. Assuming that we 
have several departments in the headquarters, we can specify a more detailed
breakdown of the mailnodes. Let's assume that we have sales and administration
departments. We would then define:

        /HQ,SALES
and:
        /HQ,ADMIN
.np
Now, we could also have several regional offices and headquarters, so we
would need to specify these regions with a geographic descriptor to uniquely
identify the regions. For example, if we had a regional office in London and
one in Johannesbug, we could then specify the mailnodes as:

        /LON,HQ,SALES
        /JHB,HQ,SALES
and:
        /LON,HQ,ADMIN
        /JHB,HQ,ADMIN

In this way, we might have two John Smiths, but their addresses would be
unique, since we specify their location using their mailnode. For example:

        John Smith /LON,HQ,SALES
and:
        John Smith /JHB,HQ,ADMIN

@entry{X400,  X.400 Addresses}

X.400 is a worldwide standard that specifies 
 
        A format for mail messages

        A way of addressing messages

The addressing mechanism that X.400 uses is a superset of OpenMail's
addressing scheme, since OpenMail is internally X.400 compliant. The X.400
addressing scheme is such as to ensure uniqueness of any X.400 mail address
anywhere in the world. In industry parlance, the X.400 address is referred to
as an OR (Originator-Recipient) address.

The public x.400 network is maintained by organizations in each country, most
often the major telecommunications companies. Each country in the world is
identified by a two letter code. For example, the code for the United Kingdom
is GB, that of the United States US and that of South Africa ZA.
.np
The telecommunication companies in each country operate Administrative
Management Domains, referred to as an ADMD. For example, British Telecom
have two ADMDs, one called BT and the other called GOLD 400, while South 
Africa's Telkom have an ADMD called TELKOM400. IBM operate ADMDs in most of 
the countries in which they are represented. Their ADMD name is IBMX400. 

Within ADMDs, private companies or organizations can register their PRMDs,
or Private Management Domains. A PRMD is the hub for an organization's 
X.400 mail, and is responsible for distributing the mail to the users who are
registered within the PRMD. 

We can further stratify the addressing by specifiying an Organization, as
many companies are hierarchically structured, and may wish to have distinct
addresses, as the mail for each separate company should be delivered to a 
different address. The X.400 code for the Organization is an O.   

.np
Within each Organization, we specify the Organizational Units. There are four 
levels of Organizational Unit, and they correspond exactly to the OpenMail 
mailnode. The Organizational Units are known as OU1 to OU4.

The last component of an X.400 address is the Personal Name, divided up into
several parts:

        1. The Given Name, or G. Example, John

        2. The Surname, or S. Example, Smith

        3. The Initials, or I. There are up to five initials. Example D. G.

The Personal Name items can be collectively referred to as P. 

.np
Let's assume that John Smith works for a company called Widget Engineering
in South Africa. Widget Engineering has contracted with Telkom to have a 
PRMD registered under Telkom's ADMD. John's X.400 address would then be

C=ZA ADMD=TELKOM400 PRMD=WIDGET OU1=JHB OU2=HQ OU3=SALES P= John D. G. Smith.

We often see this form of address on business cards.

@entry{EXTENDEDX400,  Extended X.400 Addresses}

There are a few other X.400 address items that are not commonly used, but 
should be described here for completeness.

        Domain Defined Attribute        A DDA is an unspecified item that can 
                                        be defined by an organization for 
                                        internal addressing.

        UA Unique Numeric Identifier    A User Agent is a mail front-end
                                        much like AdvanceMail/Remote. Some of 
                                        these systems deliver to a user's 
                                        mailbox by specifiying an electronic 
                                        mailbox number. It is this number that
                                        is referred to by the UA Unique 
                                        Numeric Identifier. 
                                        AdvanceMail/Remote delivers directly 
                                        to your mailbox without the need for 
                                        this number.

        X.121 Address                   This is a numeric identifier that 
                                        gives either a fax or telex number

        Telematic Terminal Identifier   This identifies a telematic terminal 
                                        by a telex answer back string or a 
                                        teletex terminal identifier.
 
The easiest way to send an X.400 message is to use the AdvanceMail/Remote 
<X.400 Address> key. To access this screen, while in the out tray, press
<Extended Address> then <X.400 Address>. 
    
@entry{POSITIONALFORMAT,  OpenMail Positional Format}

You may also enter an X.400 address directly into the distribution list 
screen. This is done in OpenMail Positional Format. The format for an 
@ref{X400,X.400} address is


        Personal Name /OU1,OU2,OU3,OU4/Organization/Country/ADMD/PRMD

Using the John smith example address,  this address would be entered in 
OpenMail Positional format as follows

        John D.G. Smith /JHB,HQ,SALES/Widget Engineering/ZA/TELKOM400/WIDGET

If you enter this address in the X.400 address screen, you will see when you
exit the screen that the address is inserted into the distribution list in 
the OpenMail Positional Format. You will find, as you become more familiar
with the use of AdvanceMail/Remote, that you will tend to use this format 
rather than entering the address using the screen driven interface.
 
When entering such an address, you will occasionally find that the addressee's
address has some unusual characters in it, characters that are illegal in an
OpenMail address. The table below shows the illegal characters and those you 
should substitute in place of these characters.

                        Key Substitutions
                __________________________________

                Backspace               Underscore
                .                       !
                /                       |
                ,                       ;
                (                       {
                )                       }


@entry{FOREIGNADDRRESS,  Foreign Addresses}

OpenMail allows you to send mail messages to foreign mail systems using the
foreign address screen. All foreign addresses are sent to an openmail gateway
that converts the mail message into the foreign format. Your OpenMail 
administrator will define a mailnode that corresponds to the address of the 
gateway.

OpenMail has built in support for sending mail to unix users. Usually, the 
mailnode that translates messages to unix mail format is know as /unix.
Foreign mail systems have an addressing format that differs from OpenMail's
address format, and this address needs to be passed to the foreign mail 
system. OpenMail uses data enclosed in parentheses immediately following the 
gateway mailnode  as the foreign mail address. Lets assume we want to send
a mail message to John smith's unix user id. John's unix mail address is

                        jsmith@widget.com


In order to send a message to John's unix id, we need to address the message
as follows

                        John Smith /unix (jsmith@widget.com)


You may fill in this address using the extended address screen.

        1. At the Create screen, type the recipient's personal name, 
           eg. John Smith

        2. Type the mailnode that corresponds to the gateway, eg. /unix

        3. Press <Other Keys>

        4. Press <Foreign Address>

        5. Complete the Foreign Address field omitting the brackets

        6. Press <Done> repeatedly until you return to the Create screen

A similar procedure is followed for all gateways that are defined on OpenMail.
Another common type of gateway is a fax gateway, that supports sending of mail
messages as faxes. Lets assume that the mailnode defined for the fax gateway
is /fx. Instead of a unix mail address, the fax gateway requires a telephone
number. You would enter a fax message address as follows


                John Smith /fx (0116835472)

@entry{DIRSEARCH2,  Searching the Directory}

If you are unsure of the address of a person to whom you wish to send mail,
you may consult the OpenMail Directory using the AdvanceMail/Remote search 
engine. The search engine is an integral part of the distribution list 
screen: wherever you enter an @ref{OPENMAILADDRESSES,address}, you may use the search engine.

Using the search engine is very simple: an asterisk matches anything, so you
can search on partial components of an address. For example, if you wish to 
search for all surnames beginning in `Co', you enter `Co*' into the 
address field and press <Enter>. AdvanceMail/Remote will pop up a list 
box in the top right corner of the screen that contains all names in the 
OpenMail directory that match the search condition.

Let's illustrate the utility of the search engine through an additional few 
examples. If you wish to search for all users whose first name is `Ian',
type `Ian *' into the address line. You can find all users whose first name
begins with `Da' and whose surname begins with `B' by typing in `Da* B*'.
Typing only a `*' will bring up all users.

OpenMail has a fuzzy search feature that allows it to bring back names
that sound like the name that you entered if it finds no exact matches. In 
order to use this feature, you need to enable the fuzzy search option. Please 
see configuring for further details on the fuzzy search capability of OpenMail 
and AdvanceMail/Remote. When doing normal searches, do not enable this option,
as a fuzzy search takes longer than a normal search to complete. For example, 
entering `Coo*' in a fuzzy search will match the following names, if present
in the directory:

        1. Cooper
        2. Couper
        3. Koupman
        4. Coomer
        5. Cumer

@entry{DIRPASSWORD,  Changing the Directory}

OpenMail has the ability to support additional directories, over and above the
system directory. AdvanceMail/Remote allows you to use alternate directories. 
Wherever you are presented with an address list to complete, you will see a 
function key labelled <Change Directry>. To change directory, press this key, 
select the desired directory name from the list box, press <Perform Change>
and enter a password, pressing <Perform Change> when done. All directory 
queries will now be directed to the new directory.

@entry{DISTLISTS,  Private Distribution Lists}

If you have groups of users to whom you frequently send mail, 
AdvanceMail/Remote and OpenMail allow you to @ref{DISTLISTCREATE,create distribution lists}. A 
distribution list is essentially an alias for a group of names. In order to 
view all your lists, from the @ref{MAINSCREEN,main screen}, highlight the List area and press
<Enter>. You will now see a tray, much like your @ref{INTRAY,In Tray}, except that 
it contains entries for your distribution lists.  You may view any of these
entries by highlighting it and pressing <Enter>. AdvanceMail/Remote will open
the list and display all the names that comprise the list. All these lists
that you see here are private lists, visible only to you.

@entry{DISTLISTCREATE,  Creating a Distribution List}

Creating a list is just as easy. From the top level List Area screen, press
the <Create> key. You will be shown your standard addressing screen, where
you may type in, each name on a separate line, the names of all people that
you wish to have in your distribution list. You may use the OpenMail @ref{DIRSEARCH2,search
engine} here, if desired. Make sure that you give the list a name by typing an
entry into the name field at the top of the screen. When you have finished 
entering the names, press <Save>, and your new list will be saved to your 
List Area for future use.

@entry{DISTLISTUSING,  Using a Distribution List}

Using a distribution list is as easy as creating a list. Let's assume that
we are @ref{CREATING,sending} a message, and we wish a copy to be sent to all members of a 
list called managers. From the addressing screen of the new message, press 
<Merge List>. AdvanceMail/Remote will bring up a list box in the top right
corner of the screen containing the names of all your distribution lists. 
Using the arrow keys, move the cursor highlight bar to managers, and press 
<Perform Merge>. AdvanceMail/Remote will extract all the names from this 
distribution list, and place each name on a separate line in your addressing 
screen.

@entry{PDL,  Public Distribution Lists}

OpenMail also supports a feature known as Public Distribution Lists, or
PDLs in OpenMail parlance. PDLs will appear in the @ref{DIRECTORY,OpenMail directory} just 
like any other address. Sending a message to a PDL will cause the message to 
be echoed to all users who are part of that PDL. It is the responsibility of 
the OpenMail Administrator to setup and maintain such PDLs. As a user, you may
assume that any PDL is always up to date. For details on the PDLs that exist
in your system, please contact your OpenMail Administrator.

@entry{NICKNAMES,Nicknames}

AdvanceMail/Remote allows you to create nicknames for users to whom you 
regularly send mail. A nickname is simply a shortened name that is an alias 
for the user's mail address. For example, you may have created a nickname for 
John Smith's address, called `John'. Whenever you use the nickname `John',
AdvanceMail/Remote will substitute the address `John Smith /JHB,HQ,SALES'.

@entry{NICKNAMECREATE,  Creating a Nickname}

Creating a nickname is as simple as entering an address. Enter the address on
a new blank line in the address screen and press <Create Nickname>.
AdvanceMail/Remote will prompt you for a nickname at the top of the screen. 
Enter the nickname you wish to use and press <Enter>. Unless the nickname is 
already assigned to another user, AdvanceMail/Remote will now associate this 
nickname with the user address you recently entered.  

@entry{NICKNAMEUSING,  Using a Nickname}

There are two ways to use a nickname. When addressing a message

        1. Enter the nickname directly into the address line, and it will be 
           replaced with the address to which it corresponds.

        2. Press the <Nickname List> key. AdvanceMail/Remote will display a 
           list box in the top right corner of the screen that contains all 
           your nicknames. Using the arrow keys, move the cursor highlight 
           bar down to the desired nickname and press <enter>

Either of these two methods will produce the same result: the user's full
@ref{OPENMAILADDRESSES,OpenMail address} will be entered on the address line on which the cursor
was positioned prior to entering/selecting the nickname.  

@entry{MESSAGESETTINGS,Message Settings}

Each message that you @ref{CREATING,send} using AdvanceMail/Remote has certain settings 
associated with it. These settings cause OpenMail to treat the message in 
subtly different ways. The message settings screen can be accessed from the 
@ref{EDITING,compose} screen by pressing the <Message Settings> function key.

The following sections describe the message settings in detail, and 
outline the effect of changing these settings.

Message Importance

This setting is for the information of the recipient(s) only, as it has no
effect on how OpenMail handles the message. It tells the recipient(s) how
important you think the message is. This field may have on of the following
three values

        1. Normal
        2. Low
        3. High

Message Priority

This setting tells the recipient(s) how urgent you think the message is and
also specifies how the message is treated by OpenMail. Messages with an 
urgent priority are delivered before messages with a normal or non-urgent 
priority. You may also control auto-forwarding or auto-reply actions based 
on the value of this field, e.g., you may choose to only forward urgent 
messages.

Message Sensitivity

Message sensitivity tells the recipient how sensitive the data contained in
the message is in your estimation. There are four possible settings for this
field. They are

        1. Not Sensitive
        2. Personal
        3. Private
        4. Company Confidential

Changing this field to private will ensure that only the recipient will be 
able to read this message. As with the message priority, you may use this
field to control your @ref{AUTOFORWARD,auto-forward} and @ref{AUTOREPLY,auto-reply} actions, e.g., you may
choose to forward only those messages that are marked `not sensitive'.

@entry{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,Acknowledgements}

OpenMail has the ability to give you information about the delivery status of
your message. There are four types of delivery notification that can be 
requested

                None            No acknowledgement will be returned 

                Delivery Ack    You will be informed when the message is 
                                delivered to the recipient's in tray

                Read Ack        You will be informed when the message is 
                                delivered and when the message is read

                Reply           You will be informed when the message is 
                                delivered, read, and when a reply to your 
                                message has been constructed by the recipient

@entry{MISCELLANEOUS,Miscellaneous Settings}

There are six message settings that fall under the heading miscellaneous 
settings. 

1. Earliest delivery date and time 

This is the earliest date and time at which OpenMail will deliver your 
message. If you leave the data blank, today's date is assumed. If you leave 
the time blank, the message will not be delivered before that start of the 
day corresponding to the supplied date.

2. Allow Public Distribution Lists

Specifies whether to allow any of the addressees in the message's @ref{DISTLISTS,distribution
list} to be PDLs
.np
3. Allow Alternative Recipients

If a message cannot be delivered, it will normally be redirected to the 
OpenMail Administrator. Select NO in this field to prevent your message being 
redirected to the OpenMail Administrator.

4. Allow Conversions

If you would like a message to be delivered to the recipient(s) only if it 
can be delivered without any file type conversions taking place, set this 
field to NO. If conversions of any sort are required in order to deliver the 
message, it will be returned to you undelivered.

5. Allow Non-Delivery Notifications.

If a message cannot be delivered, OpenMail sends you a non-delivery
notification. If you wish to prevent this, change this setting to NO.

6. Return Message with Non-Deliveries

Some mail systems will return a message along with a non-delivery notification
when the message cannot be delivered. If you wish to prevent the message being
returned, set this field to NO.

@entry{CONFIGURING,Configuring AdvanceMail/Remote}

A file called .omsrc file is stored locally in a user's home directory.
This file contains the setup options that one configures using the <Config> 
key found on the main screen. 

You may directly edit the .omsrc file, or you may use the Config option to 
change these settings. Direct editing of the config file is not supported
in the sense that the contents may change from release to release. The only
supported way to change the settings is through the Config screen.

In order to allow for a semi-automatic login to the OpenMail server, you may
enter your user name and the OpenMail server name in the first two fields.
Whenever you start up AdvanceMail/Remote, you will see that these fields are 
automagically filled in. You will then be prompted for your password. Due to
security implications, it is not possible to enter the password as a config
option.
.np
You may change the time-interval at which AdvanceMail/Remote checks for new 
mail. The default time interval is every six minutes, or 300 seconds.
You may also set the maximum age of items in your Waste Basket. Any items
older than this configured age will be emptied from the Waste Basket by the
OpenMail Server. As with all other fields in AdvanceMail/Remote which accept a 
predefined set of values, you may use <SpaceBar> to toggle between allowed 
values.

You may choose to log a copy of your outgoing messages to the message log. 
This behaviour is switched off by default. Additionally, you may wish to view
extra message information along with each message you read. This info includes
such details as Submission date, delivery date and message setting flags}. 

When viewing or printing a message, AdvanceMail/Remote normally displays at 
most ten addresses, to prevent large distribution lists swamping the output.
You may change this by editing the `Distribution List Lines When Printing'
and `Distribution List Lines When Viewing' fields.

If messages contain tab characters, these are expanded to tab stops of 8
when viewing messages. This value can be changed if you desire. Note that
the Advancemail/Remote text editor is not affected by this option at present.

You may also change your @ref{PRINTSETUP,print command}. 

@entry{PRINTSETUP,  Print Setup}

Printing under AdvanceMail/Remote is highly configurable. An exclamation mark 
is a placeholder for the message to be printed. Any command you enter on this 
line will be passed directly to the operating system with the name of a 
temporary file containing the text you wish to print substituted for the 
exclamation mark. The default print action is to send the message text to the 
first available printer though the use of the lp command.

@entry{AUTOACTIONS,  Auto Actions}

OpenMail can perform certain automatic actions for you. Of these,
AdvanceMail/Remote allows you to set up auto-forward and auto-reply actions.
The Configuration Screen indicates whether either of these auto-actions is
enabled. `YES' means that the feature is enabled, while `NO' means that the
feature is disabled.

Pressing either <Auto Forward> or <Auto Reply> will display a screen, 
described below, which allows you to configure your auto forward and auto 
reply actions.

@entry{AUTOFORWARD,    Auto Forward}

The Auto Forward screen lets you configure forwarding @ref{AUTOACTIONS,auto-actions}. You
can specify which types of messages should be auto-forwarded, and attach 
a file containing your comments to any auto-forwarded message. You also
need to specify who the messages should be auto-forwarded to.

Apart from entering the distribution list, you can toggle several options
on or off. These are:

    Auto-Forward Active:    This option lets you enable or disable auto-
                            forwarding. It also allows you to disable
                            auto-forwarding without losing your auto-
                            forward comments, distribution list, and options.
    Include Comments:	    If this option is enabled, the auto-forwarded
                            message will include your comments as the first
                            body part after the distribution list. Turning
                            this off will not destroy the comments, so you
                            enable and disable it freely.
    Delete Forwarded Mail:  If this option is set, the forwarded mail message
                            will be deleted after it has been forwarded.
    Keep Original Creator:  If this option is set, the message creator will
                            be unchanged; if set to NO, the message creator
                            will be changed to your name before forwarding.

The remaining options specify which messages should *not* be auto-forwarded.
You may not want confidential mail to be auto-forwarded, so you can disable
the auto-forwarding of different types of confidential mail with these
settings. Non-confidential mail is auto-forwarded by default.

@entry{AUTOREPLY,    Auto Reply}
 
The Auto-Reply screen lets you configure reply auto-actions. If you 
configure an auto-reply, OpenMail will automatically send a reply to
certain types of messages for you, consisting of a text message that
you create. A common use of auto-reply is when going on vacation - you
can get OpenMail to reply to any received mail telling the sender that
you are away and will reply to them yourself when you return.

From this screen, you can compose your reply by pressing the `Compose
Reply' key, or you can set the options controlling auto-reply actions.
These options are:

    Auto-Reply Active:           This option lets you turn auto-reply
                                 on or off. Setting this to OFF will
                                 not destroy the reply text.
.np
    Reply to All Messages:       If this option is set, an auto-reply
                                 will be sent to every received message.
                                 In this case, the next two options are
                                 automatically set to YES.
    Reply to URGENT Messages:    If this option is set, all urgent messages
                                 will be replied to.
    Reply to Read/Reply Acks:    This option will cause auto-replies to
                                 be sent to read and reply acknowledgements.

@entry{PASSWORD,  Changing Your Password}

In order to change your password, select <Change Password> from the Config
screen. You will be prompted at the top of the screen for your existing
password, which if you enter correctly, will cause AdvanceMail/Remote to 
prompt you for your new password. You will be prompted a second time for
your new password to ensure that there were no mistaken keypresses when you
entered your new password the first time.
