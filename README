# AdvMail/Remote - An HP OpenMail Client

Back in the 1990s I cofounded a startup with a coupe of friends that eventually became CEQURUX B.V., but 
at first we called ourselves Open Mind Solutions, and the very first thing I wrote was this code. At the 
time enterprises still largely used X.400-based email systems, and the main vendor was Hewlett-Packard
with the OpenMail X.400 system. The main problem was that in order to use it, you had to sign on to the
(Unix-based) mail server. If you were a large enterprise with hundreds or thousands of users, having everyone
sign on to the mail server was not a great experience; these systems didn't scale well. 

We had customers interested in having a proper client-server system, where the email client app ran on 
separate machines to the X.400 server. The HP OpenMail libraries supported this, but their client program
did not. And HP were asking one of our clients for a lot of money to update the client, and saying that it
would take about 9 months. Sensing an opportunity, we said we would make an exact clone of the client 
except that we would include remote server support, do it in one month, and do it for a lot less. 
And so AdvMail/Remote was born. I didn't sleep much that month. But we hit the deadline and shipped the
code, and it worked well enough we barely had any support burden afterwards and could move on to other things.
I even added some features that the HP client didn't have, like a hypertext help system. I was helped
by the fact that I had written a fair amount of curses code as part of my Ph.D. work and for Gram's Commander,
including a text editor and a help system, so I could repurpose some of that.

This was all long ago and SMTP has long displaced X.400. I'm just putting this code up for posterity. The
HP API libraries are of course not included as those were proprietary.
