# When AdvanceMail/Remote starts, it will look for the "omsrc"
# file in /etc, /usr/lib, and /usr/local/lib (in that order).
# It will then read the .omsrc file in the user's home directory.
#
# Upon exit ALL settings are written to the .omsrc file, so 
# this system-wide file is just for first-time initialisation
# of new users.
#
# The variables that can be contained in the startup files are:
#
# server - the mail server host
# user   - the user name
# password - the user's password (for auto-logon; this is a security risk!)
# print  - the local print command; use ! as a file name placeholder
# poll   - the poll interval in seconds between checks for new mail
# filetypes - the location of the OpenMail filetypes file. If not present,
#	         then the filetypes file is retrieved from the server when
#		 the user logs in. This variable can be used to force a
#		 local file to be accessed and thus reduce network use.
# links  - the location of the application links file. This file can contain
#		lines consisting of (file type number, command) pairs. When
#		composing/editing a file of that type, the corresponding
#		command will be executed. For example, the links file entry
#		"1167 vi" will result in vi being used to edit text files.
# helpfile - the location of the hypertext help text file (with the .txt
#		extension). The help index file (extension .idx) must be
#		in the same directory.
# maxaddresses - the maximum number of matching addresses to return from
#		directory searches. If an address pattern or partial
#		address matches more than this number of alternates,
#		an invalid address will be reported. Setting this to a
#		small number can reduce network traffic. The default is 64.
